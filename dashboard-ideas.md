## Vehicles

**Basic Statistics**

- Number of vehicles

  ​

**Filter Mechanics (Sliders for example)**

- Filter by cartype
- Filter by name
- Filter by year



**Possible graphs/charts we want to display**

- Fuel consumption by car type (y-axis : fuel consumption, x-axis: time)
- Pollution by car type (Maybe a bar chart is more suitable)
- Comparison of fuel consumption vs. miles driven
- Number of times each car type refuels
- Compare fuel consumption between car types on similar routes



#### Individual vehicles

For individual vehicles we may want to check how often...





## Fuel Stations 



**Filter mechanics**

- By fuel station



**Possible graphs/charts we want to display** 

- How much fuel is extracted from each station yearly/monthly/daily

- Comparison between how much fuel is added to fuel stations vs. how much is extracted

- What kind of fuel is being extracted from each station and how much of each kind
